# watcher

A very simple file system notification repeater. Very much like
[kicker][kicker], but written in Go. This is my very first Go project and is
therefore probably riddled with newbie mistakes.

Still, it's pretty neat and as far as I've tested it much faster to reaction
than kicker ever was!

## Installation
`go get github.com/thiderman/watcher`
